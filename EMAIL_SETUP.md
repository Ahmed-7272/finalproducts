# Email Setup Guide for CallMint.tech - Gmail Integration

## üöÄ Complete Guide to Set Up Real Email Reception

This guide will help you configure your CallMint.tech website to receive real emails through your Gmail account.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Gmail Account** - You need an active Gmail account with 2FA enabled
2. **App Password** - You'll need to generate an app password for SMTP access
3. **Domain Setup** - Optional: You can use a custom domain with Gmail

## üîß Step 1: Configure Your Gmail Account

### Generate App Password
1. Log into your Gmail account
2. Go to **Google Account Settings** ‚Üí **Security**
3. Enable **2-Factor Authentication** (required for app passwords)
4. Go to **App passwords** under Security
5. Generate a new **App Password** for "Mail"
6. Save this password securely - you'll need it for the environment variables

### Verify SMTP Settings
- **Host**: `smtp.gmail.com`
- **Port**: `587` (STARTTLS) or `465` (SSL)
- **Security**: STARTTLS for port 587, SSL for port 465
- **Authentication**: Required

## üîë Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file with your actual Gmail credentials:

```env
# Email Configuration for Gmail
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=Mohammed.ayaz@azmaoudperfumes.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=xczalntpevxexetj
EMAIL_FROM=Mohammed.ayaz@azmaoudperfumes.com
EMAIL_SECURE=false

# Recipient email for contact forms
CONTACT_EMAIL=Mohammed.ayaz@azmaoudperfumes.com
```

**Configuration Details:**
- `Mohammed.ayaz@azmaoudperfumes.com` - Your Gmail address
- `xczalntpevxexetj` - Your Gmail app password (no spaces, already configured)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### Authentication Errors
```
Error: Invalid login: 535 Authentication failed
```
**Solution**: 
- Verify your Gmail address and app password are correct
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on your Google account
- Make sure you're using a Gmail app password, not your regular password
- Check that "Less secure app access" is disabled (use app passwords instead)

#### Connection Errors
```
Error: Connection timeout
```
**Solution**:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify SMTP settings (host, port)
- Try port 465 with SSL instead of 587 with STARTTLS

#### SSL/TLS Errors
```
Error: SSL Error
```
**Solution**:
- For port 587, set `EMAIL_SECURE=false`
- For port 465, set `EMAIL_SECURE=true`

### Enable Debug Mode
Add this to your `.env.local` for detailed logging:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
```

## üì± Step 5: Production Setup

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Environment Variables**: Set all email variables in your hosting platform
2. **Security**: Never commit real credentials to Git
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor email delivery rates
4. **Backup**: Have a backup email service ready
